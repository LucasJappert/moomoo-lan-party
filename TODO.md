# 🧠 PATHFINDING STRATEGY – HIGH PRIORITY

We must **improve the pathfinding logic** so that movement feels more natural and polished, similar to games like _Dota_.

Currently, some path decisions feel rigid or too direct. We want to aim for smoother movement behavior, intelligent avoidance, and better collision handling when units crowd together.

This guide provides advanced techniques such as flow fields, dynamic obstacle adjustments, and practical examples for top-down games.

# ✅ TODO List – MooMoo LAN Party

This file tracks upcoming features and tasks in development. Contributions are welcome!

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED (for reference)

- [x] LAN connection between players.
- [x] Player spawning using MultiplayerSpawner.
- [x] Player movement via CharacterBody2D.
- [x] Player synchronization using MultiplayerSynchronizer.

---

## 🔄 BASIC MULTIPLAYER SYNC

- [x] Set up a separate MultiplayerSpawner for enemies.
- [x] Control enemies only from the server (`is_multiplayer_authority()`).
- [x] Synchronize enemy state using MultiplayerSynchronizer (position, animation, HP).
- [x] Enable interpolation for smoother enemy movement.
- [x] Sort all nodes (enemies, players, Moomoo) by Y position.

---

## 🔄 ENTITY CLASS

- [x] Implement a state machine for the Entity class to handle different states (e.g. idle, moving, attacking, dead).

---

## 👾 ENEMIES & WAVES

- [x] Create reusable `Enemy.tscn` scene.
- [x] Implement wave-based enemy spawning system.
- [x] Move enemies using Godot's PathFinding2D.
- [x] Add basic AI (chase nearest player, or move towards Moomoo if none are in range).
- [x] Handle collisions and damage between players and enemies.
- [x] Enemy death handling and cleanup.

---

## ⚔️ COMBAT & PROGRESSION

- [x] Add health system (`hp`) for players and enemies.
- [ ] Add player experience and leveling system.
- [ ] Implement player abilities (Q, W, E, R).
- [ ] Create shop system to buy items (UI + gold).
- [ ] Sync damage, effects, and auras.

---

## 📡 NETWORK OPTIMIZATION

- [ ] Implement `update_enemy_visibility_for_peer(peer_id)` function to reduce sync traffic.
- [ ] Assign sync authority only to clients near each enemy.
- [ ] Add visibility update cooldown (every 1–2s).
- [ ] Group enemies by zones/chunks for larger maps.

---

## 🧭 UI & FEEDBACK

- [ ] Hero selection screen on connect.
- [ ] Health bar and name display over each player/enemy.
- [ ] UI for gold, experience, and abilities.
- [ ] Game over screen (win/lose).

---

## 🛠️ OTHER USEFUL FEATURES

- [ ] Provide `.bat` or `.sh` launch scripts for easy startup.
- [ ] Add logging system for debugging multiplayer sync.
- [ ] Save stats at end of game session.
- [ ] Optional: local joystick/gamepad support.

Let’s build MooMoo LAN Party together! 🐮

MY TODOs:

- Mejorar el mapa agregando árboles, cercas, etc
- Corregir movimientos en diagonal cuando en realidad no se deberia permitir si los tiles adyacentes estan bloqueados
- Agregar objetos mobiles sobre el terreno como plantas, bichos, nubes, etc.
